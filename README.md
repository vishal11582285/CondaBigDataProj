In this study, our aim is to understand the sentiment of user text review at the instance
(sentence) level. We will use state of the art convolution neural networks as primary
classification model and refine it with a custom function that will provide a sentiment for
every sentence in long review. The dataset used in this study is IMDB movie review set.
This algorithm performed with a 93% benchmark accuracy on our data set. We conducted
the implementation in Python.
